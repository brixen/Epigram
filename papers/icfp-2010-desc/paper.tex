\section{Introduction}

The text of the paper begins here. \cite{morris:spf}

ACM bullet points, we offer:
\begin{itemize}
\item a closed presentation of data-types (no generativity requires)
  subsuming standard inductive families (some popular extensions
  excluded for now)
\item descriptions of data-types are first-class (indeed,
  self-encoded)
\item ``generic programming is just programming''
\item first serious attempt to design a language for generic
  programming, except possibly Lisp
\end{itemize}

\begin{structure}
<- presentation of the Core theory
    -> judgemental equality (extensional (a la OTT?))
    /> not Epigram specific 
        <- having OTT just buys you more stuffs
\end{structure}

%% Desc
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{A simple universe of descriptions}

\begin{structure}
<- a universe of simple inductive types
    -> nil, arg, ind, hind
<- levitation
\end{structure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% IDesc
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Indexing descriptions}


\begin{structure}
<- enumerations
<- indexing
    -> nil, arg, ind, hind
    -> var, Pi, Sigma, :-, x, Sigma_f
<- closure under \box and \diamond
<- Brady optimization as desc transformation
<- ``standard'' descriptions start with Sigma_f
    -> SIDesc : I -> (E : EnumU) -> Branches(E , \ e -> IDesc I )
<- ``standard'' descriptions closed under the free monad constructions
<- IDesc is just such a free monad
\end{structure}

\section{Discussion}

\begin{structure}
<- universe stratification
    -> how would IDesc play with it?
