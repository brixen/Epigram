\section{Introduction}

The text of the paper begins here. \cite{morris:spf}

ACM bullet points, we offer:
\begin{itemize}
\item a closed presentation of data-types (no generativity requires)
  subsuming standard inductive families (some popular extensions
  excluded for now)
\item descriptions of data-types are first-class (indeed,
  self-encoded)
\item ``generic programming is just programming''
\item first serious attempt to design a language for generic
  programming, except possibly Lisp
\end{itemize}

\begin{structure}
<- presentation of the Core theory
    -> judgemental equality (extensional (a la OTT?))
    /> not Epigram specific 
        <- having OTT just buys you more stuffs
\end{structure}


\subsection{Base theory}

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\Gamma\vdash\Valid & \mbox{\(\Gamma\) is a valid context, giving types to
                    variables} \\
\Gamma\vdash \Bhab{t}{T} & \mbox{term \(t\) has type \(T\) in context \(\Gamma\)} \\
\Gamma\vdash \Bhab{s \equiv t}{T} & \mbox{\(s\) and \(t\) are equal at type \(T\)
   in context \(\Gamma\)} \\
\end{array}
\]

The systems of inference rules will be formulated to ensure that that the
following implications always hold by induction on derivations.
\[
\begin{array}{l@{\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;}l}
\Gamma\vdash \Bhab{t}{T}            & \Gamma\vdash\Valid \;\wedge\; \Gamma\vdash\Type{T} \\
\Gamma\vdash s \equiv \Bhab{t}{T}   & \Gamma\vdash \Bhab{s}{T} \;\wedge\; \Gamma\vdash \Bhab{t}{T} \\
\Gamma;\xS;\Delta \vdash J          & \Gamma\vdash \Bhab{s}{S} \;\Rightarrow\; 
                                           \Gamma;\Delta[s/x] \vdash J[s/x] \\
\end{array}
