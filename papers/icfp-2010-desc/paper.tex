\section{Introduction}

The text of the paper begins here. \cite{morris:spf}

ACM bullet points, we offer:
\begin{itemize}
\item a closed presentation of data-types (no generativity requires)
  subsuming standard inductive families (some popular extensions
  excluded for now)
\item descriptions of data-types are first-class (indeed,
  self-encoded)
\item ``generic programming is just programming''
\item first serious attempt to design a language for generic
  programming, except possibly Lisp
\end{itemize}

\begin{structure}
<- presentation of the Core theory
    -> judgemental equality (extensional (a la OTT?))
    /> not Epigram specific 
        <- having OTT just buys you more stuffs
\end{structure}
