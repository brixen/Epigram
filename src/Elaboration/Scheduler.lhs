Handling elaboration essentially requires writing an operating
system. Having defined how to execute processes in
section~\ref{sec:Elaborator.Elaborator}, we now turn our attention to
process scheduling. The scheduler is called when an elaboration
process yields (either halting after solving its goal, halting with an
error, or suspending work until later). It searches downwards in the
proof state for unstable elaboration problems and executes any it
finds.

When the scheduler is started, all problems before the working location should
be stable, but there may be unstable problems in the current location and below
it. The |startScheduler| command runs the scheduler from the current location,
so it will stabilise the children and return to where it started.

> startScheduler :: ProofState ()
> startScheduler = getCurrentName >>= scheduler

In general, the scheduler might have to move non-locally (e.g. in order to solve
goals elsewhere in the proof state), so it keeps track of a target location to
return to. When |scheduler| is called, it checks to see if there might be any
suspended problems below the current location. If so, it resets the suspend
state and starts searching from the top of the development. If not, it calls
|schedulerDone| to move out or terminate as appropriate.

> scheduler :: Name -> ProofState ()
> scheduler n = do
>     ss <- (|devSuspendState getAboveCursor|)
>     case ss of
>         SuspendUnstable  -> do  putDevSuspendState SuspendNone
>                                 cursorTop
>                                 schedulerContinue n
>         _                -> schedulerDone n

The |schedulerContinue| command processes the entries below the
cursor. The suspend state should describe the entries above the
cursor. If there are no entries below, we are done. If we find a
parameter, we simply move past it, because it cannot have a suspended
problem attached. If we find a definition, we enter it, try to resume
its current entry, then search its children from the top.

> schedulerContinue :: Name -> ProofState ()
> schedulerContinue n = do
>     cs <- getBelowCursor
>     case cs of
>         F0                      -> schedulerDone n
>         EPARAM _ _ _ _ _ :> _   -> cursorDown >> schedulerContinue n
>         _ :> _                  -> do
>             cursorDown
>             goIn
>             resumeCurrentEntry
>             scheduler n


Once done, the |schedulerDone| command checks if this is the target
location.  If so, we stop; otherwise, we resume the current entry and
continue searching.

> schedulerDone :: Name -> ProofState ()
> schedulerDone n = do
>         mn <- getCurrentName
>         case mn of
>             _ | mn == n  -> cursorBottom
>             []           -> error "scheduler: got lost!"
>             _            -> do
>                 b <- resumeCurrentEntry
>                 if b  then scheduler n
>                       else do
>                           goOutBelow
>                           schedulerContinue n


The |resumeCurrentEntry| command checks for an unstable elaboration
problem on the current entry of the current location, and resumes
elaboration if it finds one. If elaboration succeeds, it gives the
resulting term. It returns whether an elaboration process was resumed
(not whether the process succeeded).

> resumeCurrentEntry :: ProofState Bool
> resumeCurrentEntry = do
>   tip <- getDevTip
>   case tip of
>     Suspended (ty :=>: tyv) prob | isUnstable prob -> do
>         putDevTip (Unknown (ty :=>: tyv))
>         mn <- getCurrentName
>         schedTrace $ "scheduler: resuming elaboration on " ++ showName mn
>                           ++ ":  \n" ++ show prob
>         mtt <- resume (ty :=>: tyv) prob
>         case mtt of
>             Just tt  ->  give (termOf tt)
>                      >>  schedTrace "scheduler: elaboration done."
>             Nothing  ->  schedTrace "scheduler: elaboration suspended."
>         return True
>     _ -> return False


Given a (potentially, but not necessarily, unstable) elaboration problem for the
current location, we can |resume| it to try to produce a term. If this suceeds,
the cursor will be in the same location, but if it fails (i.e.\ the problem has
been suspended) then the cursor could be anywhere earlier in the proof state.

If we have a |WaitSolve| problem where the hole has already been solved with
something else, we need to ensure the solution is compatible. If the two
solutions are definitionally equal, everything is fine, otherwise we hope
for a proof of their equality. \adam{At the moment this proof isn't used,
but hoping for it might cause things to be solved usefully anyway. Is
there a better way to do this?}
