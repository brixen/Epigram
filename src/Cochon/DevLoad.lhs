\subsection{Parsing a Development}

To parse a development, we represent it as a list of |DevLine|s, each
of which corresponds to a |Parameter| or |Definition| entry and stores
enough information to reconstruct it. Note that at this stage, we
simply tag each definition with a list of commands to execute later.

> data DevLine
>   =  DLParam ParamKind String DInTmRN
>   |  DLDef String [DevLine] (Maybe DInTmRN :<: DInTmRN) [CTData]
>   |  DLModule String [DevLine] [CTData]

A module may have a list of definitions in square brackets, followed
by an optional semicolon-separated list of commands.

> parseDevelopment :: Parsley Token [DevLine]
> parseDevelopment  = bracket Square (many (pDef <|> pModule)) 
>                   <|> pure []

\subsubsection{Parsing definitions}

A definition is an identifier, followed by a list of children, a definition
(which may be @?@), and optionally a list of commands:

> pDef :: Parsley Token DevLine
> pDef =  (| DLDef    ident                  -- identifier
>                     pLines                 -- childrens (optional)
>                     pDefn                  -- definition
>                     pCTSuffix              -- commands (optional)
>                     (%keyword KwSemi%) 
>          |)

\paragraph{Parsing children:}

Children, if any, are enclosed inside square brackets. They can be of
several types: definitions, that we have already defined, or
parameters. Parameters are defined below. The absence of
sub-development is signaled by the @:=@ symbol.

> pLines  :: Parsley Token [DevLine]
> pLines  =  bracket Square (many (pDef <|> pParam <|> pModule)) 
>         <|> (keyword KwDefn *> pure [])

\paragraph{Parsing definitions:}

A definition is either a question mark or a term, ascripted by a
type. The question mark corresponds to an open goal. On the other
hand, giving a term corresponds to explicitly solving the goal.

> pDefn :: Parsley Token (Maybe DInTmRN :<: DInTmRN)
> pDefn  =  (| (%identEq "?"%) (%keyword KwAsc%)
>                   ~Nothing :<: pDInTm 
>           |  id pAsc
>           |)
>   where pAsc = do
>          tm :<: ty <- pAscription
>          return $ Just tm :<: ty

\paragraph{Parsing commands:}

Commands can be typed directly in the developments by enclosing them
inside @[| ... |]@ brackets. They are parsed in one go by
|pCochonTactics|, so this is quite fragile. This is better used when
we know things work.

> pCTSuffix  :: Parsley Token [CTData]
> pCTSuffix  = bracket (SquareB "") pCochonTactics 
>            <|> pure []


\subsubsection{Parsing Modules}

A module is similar, but has no definition.

> pModule :: Parsley Token DevLine
> pModule =  (| DLModule  ident                  -- identifier
>                         pLines                 -- children (optional)
>                         pCTSuffix              -- commands (optional)
>                         (%keyword KwSemi%) 
>            |)

\subsubsection{Parsing Parameters}

A parameter is a $\lambda$-abstraction (represented by @\ x : T ->@) or a
$\Pi$-abstraction (represented by @(x : S) ->@).

> pParam :: Parsley Token DevLine
> pParam =  (|  (%keyword KwLambda%)          -- @\@
>             (DLParam ParamLam)              
>             ident                         -- @x@
>             (%keyword KwAsc%)             -- @:@
>             (sizedDInTm (pred ArrSize))   -- @T@
>             (%keyword KwArr%) |)          -- @->@
>         <|> 
>             (bracket Round                -- @(@
>              (|  (DLParam ParamPi)              
>                  ident                    -- @x@
>                  (%keyword KwAsc%)        -- @:@
>                  pDInTm |)) <*            -- @S)@
>                  keyword KwArr            -- @->@


\subsection{Construction}

Once we have parsed a development as a list of |DevLine|, we interpret
it in the |ProofState| monad. This is the role of |makeDev|. It
updates the proof state to represent the given list of |DevLine|s,
accumulating pairs of names and command lists along the way.

> type NamedCommand = (Name, [CTData])
>
> makeDev :: [DevLine] -> [NamedCommand] -> ProofState [NamedCommand]
> makeDev []      ncs = return ncs
> makeDev (l:ls)  ncs = makeEntry l ncs >>= makeDev ls

Each line of development is processed by |makeEntry|. This is where
the magic happen and the |ProofState| is updated.

> makeEntry :: DevLine -> [NamedCommand] -> ProofState [NamedCommand]

\paragraph{Making a definition:}

To make a definition, we operate in 4 steps. First of all, we jump in
a module in which we make our kids. Once this is done, we resolve our
display syntax goal into a term: we are therefore able to turn the
module in a definition. The third step consists in solving the problem
if we were provided a solution, or give up if not. Finally, we
accumulate the commands which might have been issued.

> makeEntry (DLDef x kids (mtipTm :<: tipTys) commands) ncs = do
>     -- Open a module named by her name
>     n <- makeModule x
>     goIn
>     -- Recursively build the kids
>     ncs' <- makeDev kids ncs
>     -- Translate |tipTys| into a real |INTM|
>     tipTy :=>: tipTyv <- elaborate' (SET :>: tipTys)
>     -- Turn the module into a definition of |tipTy|
>     moduleToGoal tipTy
>     -- Were we provided a solution?
>     case mtipTm of
>         Nothing -> do -- No.
>                    -- Leave
>                    goOut
>         Just tms -> do -- Yes!
>             -- Give the solution |tms|
>             elabGive tms
>             return ()
>     -- Is there any tactics to be executed?
>     case commands of
>         []  -> do -- No.
>                -- Return the kids' commands
>                return ncs'
>         _   -> do -- Yes!
>                -- Accumulate our commands 
>                -- With the ones from the kids
>                return $ (n, commands) : ncs'

\paragraph{Making a Module:}

Making a module involves much less effort than to make a
definition. This is indeed a stripped-down version of the above code
for definitions.

> makeEntry (DLModule x kids commands) ncs = do
>     -- Make the module
>     n <- makeModule x
>     goIn
>     -- Recursively build the kids
>     ncs' <- makeDev kids ncs
>     -- Leave
>     goOut
>     -- Is there any tactics to be executed?
>     case commands of
>         []  -> do -- No.
>                -- Return the kids' commands
>                return ncs'
>         _   -> do -- Yes!
>                -- Accumulate our commands 
>                -- With the ones from the kids
>                return $ (n, commands) : ncs'

\paragraph{Making a Parameter:}

To make a parameter, be it Lambda or Pi, is straightforward. First, we
need to translate the type in display syntax to an |INTM|. Then, we
make a fresh reference of that type. Finally, we store that reference
in the development.

> makeEntry (DLParam k x tys) ncs = do
>     -- Translate the display |tys| into an |INTM|
>     ty :=>: tyv <- elaborate' (SET :>: tys)
>     -- Make a fresh reference of that type
>     freshRef (x :<: tyv) (\ref ->
>         -- Register |ref| as a Lambda
>         putEntryAbove (EPARAM ref (mkLastName ref) k ty)
>       ) 
>     -- Pass the accumulated commands
>     return ncs


\subsection{Loading the files}

Once we have parsed a list of |DevLine|s, we need to construct a |Dev|
from them.  The idea is to use commands defined in
Section~\ref{sec:ProofState.Edition.ProofState} to build up the proof
state.

> devLoad :: String -> IO (Bwd ProofContext)
> devLoad file = do
>   -- Load the development file
>   let devFile = dropExtension file ++ ".dev" 
>   devFileH <- (openFile devFile ReadMode >>= return . Just)
>               `catchError` \ _ -> return Nothing   
>   devLoad' devFileH $
>       withFile file ReadMode readCommands

> devLoad' :: Maybe Handle -> IO [CTData] -> IO (Bwd ProofContext)
> devLoad'  fileH commandLoad = do
>   -- Load the development file
>   dev <- case fileH of
>            Just f   -> loadDevelopment f
>            Nothing  -> return []
>   -- Load the development in an empty proof state
>   case runStateT (makeDev dev [] `catchError` catchUnprettyErrors) emptyContext of
>     Left errs -> do
>       putStrLn "Failed to load development:"
>       putStrLn $ renderHouseStyle $ prettyStackError errs
>       exitFailure
>     Right (ncs, loc) -> do
>       -- Load the commands
>       commands <- commandLoad
>       -- Run them
>       doCTacticsAt (([], commands) : ncs) (B0 :< loc)


The following companion function takes care of the dirty details: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Loading the content of the file;
\item Tokenizing the file
\item Parsing the development
\end{itemize}

> loadDevelopment :: Handle -> IO [DevLine]
> loadDevelopment file = do
>     f <- hGetContents file
>     -- Tokenize the development file
>     case parse tokenize f of
>       Left err -> do
>         putStrLn $ "loadDevelopment: failed to tokenize:\n" ++ 
>                    show err
>         exitFailure
>       Right toks ->
>           -- Parse the development
>           case parse parseDevelopment toks of
>             Left err -> do
>               putStrLn $ "loadDevelopment: failed to parse:\n" ++
>                            show err
>               exitFailure
>             Right dev -> do
>               -- Return the result
>               return dev
