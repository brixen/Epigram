Recall from Section~\ref{sec:developments} the definition of a
development:

< type Dev = (f (Entry f), Tip, NameSupply)

We ``unzip`` (cf. Huet's Zipper~\cite{huet:zipper}) this type to
produce a type representing its one-hole context. This allows us to
keep track of the location of a working development and perform local
navigation easily.


\subsection{The derivative: |Layer|}


Hence, we define |Layer| by unzipping |Dev|. Each |Layer| of the
zipper is a record with the following fields:

\begin{description}
\item[|aboveEntries|] appearing \emph{above} the working development
\item[|currenEntry|] data about the working development
\item[|belowEntries|] appearing \emph{below} the working development
\item[|layTip|] the |Tip| of the development that contains the current entry
\item[|layNSupply|] the |NameSupply| of the development that contains the 
                    current entry
\item[|laySuspendState|] the state of the development that contains the
                         current entry
\end{description}

> data Layer = Layer
>   {  aboveEntries     :: Entries
>   ,  currentEntry     :: CurrentEntry
>   ,  belowEntries     :: NewsyEntries
>   ,  layTip           :: Tip
>   ,  layNSupply       :: NameSupply
>   ,  laySuspendState  :: SuspendState
>   }
>  deriving Show

The derivative makes sense only for definitions and modules, which
have sub-developments. Parameters being childless, they `derive to
0'. Hence, the data about the working development is the derivative of
the Definition and Module data-types defined in
Section~\ref{sec:developments_entry}.

> data CurrentEntry  =  CDefinition DefKind REF (String, Int) INTM
>                    |  CModule Name
>     deriving Show

One would expect the |belowEntries| to be an |Entries|, just as the
|aboveEntries|. However, the |belowEntries| needs to be a richer
structure to support the news infrastructure
(Section~\ref{sec:news}). Indeed, we propagate reference updates
lazily, by pushing news bulletin below the current cursor.

Hence, the |belowEntries| are not only normal entries but also contain
news. We define a |newtype| for the composition of the |Fwd| and
|Either NewsBulletin| functors, and use this functor for defining the
type of |belowEntries|.

> newtype NewsyFwd x = NF { unNF :: Fwd (Either NewsBulletin x) }
>
> type NewsyEntries = NewsyFwd (Entry NewsyFwd)

Note that |aboveEntries| are |Entries|, that is |Bwd|
list. |belowEntries| are |NewsyEntries|, hence |Fwd| list. This
justifies some piece of kit to deal with this global context.


%if False

> deriving instance Show (Dev NewsyFwd)

> instance Show (NewsyFwd (Entry NewsyFwd)) where
>     show (NF ls) = show ls
> instance Show (Entry NewsyFwd) where
>     show (EEntity ref xn e t) = intercalate " " ["E", show ref, show xn, show e, show t]
>     show (EModule n d) = intercalate " " ["M", show n, show d]
> instance Show (Entity NewsyFwd) where
>     show (Parameter k) = "Param " ++ show k
>     show (Definition k d) = "Def " ++ show k ++ " " ++ show d
> instance Traversable NewsyFwd where
>     traverse g (NF x) = NF <$> traverse (traverse g) x
> instance Foldable NewsyFwd where
>     foldMap = foldMapDefault
> instance Functor NewsyFwd where
>     fmap = fmapDefault

%endif

\subsection{The Zipper: |ProofContext|}


Once we have the derivative, the zipper is almost here. The proof
context is represented by a stack of layers (|pcLayers|), ending with
the working development (|pcDev|) above the cursor and the entries
below the cursor (|pcBelowCursor|)..

> data ProofContext = PC
>     {  pcLayers       :: Bwd Layer
>     ,  pcAboveCursor  :: Dev Bwd
>     ,  pcBelowCursor  :: Fwd (Entry Bwd)
>     }
>   deriving Show

The |emptyContext| corresponds to the following (purposedly verbose)
definition:

> emptyContext :: ProofContext
> emptyContext = PC  {  pcLayers = B0
>                    ,  pcAboveCursor = Dev  {  devEntries       = B0
>                                            ,  devTip           = Module
>                                            ,  devNSupply       = (B0, 0)
>                                            ,  devSuspendState  = SuspendNone }
>                    ,  pcBelowCursor = F0 }
