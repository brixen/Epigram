A module is a pretty dull thing: it is just a name and a
development. As far as I know, there are three usages of modules. The
first one is the one we are used to: introducing namespaces and
avoiding name clashes. This is mostly used at the programming
level. For making modules, we use |makeModule|.

> makeModule :: String -> ProofState Name
> makeModule s = do
>     nsupply <- getDevNSupply
>     let n = mkName nsupply s
>     -- Insert a new entry above, the empty module |s|
>     let dev = Dev {  devEntries       =  B0
>                   ,  devTip           =  Module 
>                   ,  devNSupply       =  freshNSpace nsupply s
>                   ,  devSuspendState  =  SuspendNone }
>     putEntryAbove $ EModule  {  name   =  n 
>                              ,  dev    =  dev}
>     putDevNSupply $ freshName nsupply
>     return n


The second usage is more technical, and occurs exclusively in the
implementation (such as in tactics, for instance). It consists in
making a module, going in it, doing some constructions and analyses,
and at some stage wanting to say that this module is actually an open
definition of a certain type (a goal). Turning a module into a goal is
implemented by |moduleToGoal|. An instance of this pattern appears in
Section~\ref{subsec:Tactics.Elimination.analysis}.

> moduleToGoal :: INTM -> ProofState (EXTM :=>: VAL)
> moduleToGoal ty = do
>     (_ :=>: tyv) <- checkHere (SET :>: ty)
>     CModule n <- getCurrentEntry
>     inScope <- getInScope
>     let  ty' = liftType inScope ty
>          ref = n := HOLE Waiting :<: evTm ty'
>     putCurrentEntry $ CDefinition LETG ref (last n) ty'
>     putDevTip $ Unknown (ty :=>: tyv)
>     return $ applySpine ref inScope


The last usage of modules is to mess around: introducing things in the
proof context to later, in one go, remove it all. One need to be
extremely careful with the removed objects: the risk of introducing
dangling references is high.

> draftModule :: String -> ProofState t -> ProofState t
> draftModule name draftyStuff = do
>     makeModule name
>     goIn
>     t <- draftyStuff
>     goOutBelow
>     mm <- removeEntryAbove
>     case mm of
>         Just (EModule _ _) -> return t
>         _ -> throwError' . err $ "draftModule: drafty " ++ name
>                                  ++ " did not end up in the right place!"
