The |make| command adds a named goal of the given type above the
cursor. The meat is actually in |makeKinded|, below.

> make :: (String :<: INTM) -> ProofState (EXTM :=>: VAL)
> make = makeKinded Waiting

When making a new definition, the reference to this definition bears a
\emph{hole kind}
(Section~\ref{subsec:Evidences.Tm.references}). User-generated goals
are of kind |Waiting|: waiting for the user to solve it (or, if lucky,
an automation tool could nail it down). For making these kind of
definition, we will use the |make| command above. However, during
Elaboration for instance (Section~\ref{sec:Elaborator.Elaborator}),
the proof system will insert goals itself, with a somewhat changing
mood such as |Hoping| or |Crying|.

> makeKinded :: HKind -> (String :<: INTM) -> ProofState (EXTM :=>: VAL)
> makeKinded holeKind (name :<: ty) = do
>     -- Check that the type is indeed a type
>     _ :=>: tyv <- checkHere (SET :>: ty) 
>                     `pushError`  
>                     (err "make: " ++ errTm (DTIN ty) ++ err " is not a set.")
>     -- Make a name for the goal, from |name|
>     nsupply <- getDevNSupply
>     goalName <- pickName "Goal" name
>     let  n  =  mkName nsupply goalName
>     -- Make a reference for the goal, with a lambda-lifted type
>     inScope <- getInScope
>     let  liftedTy  =  liftType inScope ty
>          ref       =  n := HOLE holeKind :<: evTm liftedTy
>     -- Make an entry for the goal, with an empty development
>     let dev = Dev { devEntries       =  B0
