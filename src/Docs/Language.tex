\section{Language}

At present, this section only contains a few meaningless scribbles on the 
language of types. We would like to write:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|*| for the universe of sets
\item \verb!\ x . t! for the $\lambda$-term $\lambda x.t$
\item \verb|f a| for $f$ applied to $a$ (no surprises here)
\item \verb!(x : S) -> T! for the $\Pi$-type $\Pi x:S. T$
\item \verb!S -> T! for the same $\Pi$-type if $T$ is independent of $x$
\item \verb!(x : S)(y : T) -> U! for the nested $\Pi$-type $\Pi x:S. \Pi y:T. U$
\item \verb!{| P}! for the type of proofs of $P$ (cf.\ set notation)
\item \verb!{x : S | P}! for the $\Sigma$-type $\Sigma x:S. P$
\item \verb!{x : S, y : T | P}! for the nested $\Sigma$-type $\Sigma x:S. \Sigma y:T. P$
\end{itemize}

This is all very tenative. One overriding principle is that we should stick to ASCII
characters throughout. Users may use Unicode if they wish, but it should not be
forced upon them.
