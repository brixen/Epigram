Let's have some observational equality, now!
\cite{altenkirch_mcbride_swierstra:obs_equality}

\question{Can we move this to the appropriate feature file?
Does nested use of import aspects work?}


%format <-> = "\leftrightarrow"

The |eqGreen| operator, defined in
section~\ref{sec:Features.Equality}, computes the proposition that two
values are equal if their containing sets are equal. We write |<->|
for application of this operator.

> (<->) :: (TY :>: VAL) -> (TY :>: VAL) -> VAL
> (y0 :>: t0) <-> (y1 :>: t1) = eqGreen @@ [y0,t0,y1,t1]


We define the computational behaviour of the |eqGreen| operator as follows,

> opRunEqGreen :: [VAL] -> Either NEU VAL

> import <- OpRunEqGreen

> opRunEqGreen [C (Pi sS1 tT1), f1, C (Pi sS2 tT2), f2] = Right $ 
>   ALL sS1 . L . HF "s1" $  \ s1 -> ALL sS2 . L . HF "s2" $ \ s2 ->
>   IMP  (EQBLUE (sS1 :>: s1) (sS2 :>: s2)) $
>   (tT1 $$ A s1 :>: f1 $$ A s1) <-> (tT2 $$ A s2 :>: f2 $$ A s2)

> opRunEqGreen [SET, PI sS1 tT1, SET, PI sS2 tT2] = Right $
>    AND  ((SET :>: sS2) <-> (SET :>: sS1))
>         (ALL sS2 . L . HF "s2" $ \ s2 -> ALL sS1 . L . HF "s1" $  \ s1 ->
>            IMP  (EQBLUE (sS2 :>: s2) (sS1 :>: s1)) $
>            (SET :>: tT1 $$ A s1) <-> (SET :>: tT2 $$ A s2))

> opRunEqGreen [SET, C (Mu (_ :?=: Id t0)), SET, C (Mu (_ :?=: Id t1))] = 
>     opRunEqGreen [desc, t0, desc, t1]

Unless overridden by a feature or preceding case, we determine equality
of canonical values in canonical sets by labelling subterms of the values
with their types, half-zipping them together (ensuring that the head
constructors are identical) and requiring that the subterms are equal.

> opRunEqGreen [C ty0, C t0, C ty1, C t1] =
>     case halfZip (fmap termOf t0') (fmap termOf t1') of
>         Nothing  -> Right ABSURD 
>         Just x   -> Right $ mkEqConj (trail x)
>   where
>     Right t0'  = canTy (\tx@(t :>: x) -> Right (tx :=>: x)) (ty0 :>: t0)
>     Right t1'  = canTy (\tx@(t :>: x) -> Right (tx :=>: x)) (ty1 :>: t1)

If we are trying to equate a function and a canonical value, we
don't have much hope.

> opRunEqGreen [_,     L _,   _,     C _   ] = Right ABSURD
> opRunEqGreen [_,     C _,   _,     L _   ] = Right ABSURD

If one of the arguments is neutral, we blame it for being unable to compute.

> opRunEqGreen [C _,   N t0,  C _,   _     ] = Left t0
> opRunEqGreen [C _,   _,     C _,   N t1  ] = Left t1
> opRunEqGreen [N y0,  _,     _,     _     ] = Left y0 
> opRunEqGreen [_,     _,     N y1,  _     ] = Left y1

Otherwise, something has gone horribly wrong.

> opRunEqGreen as = error $ "opRunEqGreen: unmatched " ++ show as


The |mkEqConj| function builds a conjunction of |eqGreen| propositions
by folding over a list. It is uniformly structural for canonical
terms, ignoring contravariance. Therefore, this requires a special
case for |Pi| in |opRunEqGreen|.

> mkEqConj :: [(TY :>: VAL,TY :>: VAL)] -> VAL
> mkEqConj ((tt0, tt1) : [])  = tt0 <-> tt1
> mkEqConj ((tt0, tt1) : xs)  = AND (tt0 <-> tt1) (mkEqConj xs)
> mkEqConj []                 = TRIVIAL


The |coeh| function takes two types, a proof that they are equal and a value
in the first type; it produces a value in the second type and a proof that
it is equal to the original value. If the sets are definitinoally equal then
this is easy, otherwise it applies |coe| to the value and uses the coherence
axiom |coh| to produce the proof.

> coeh :: TY -> TY -> VAL -> VAL -> (VAL, VAL)
> coeh s t q v | partialEq s t q  = (v, pval refl $$ A s $$ A v)
> coeh s t q v = (coe @@ [s, t, q, v], coh @@ [s, t, q, v])


The |coerce| function transports values between equal canonical sets. Given two
sets built from the same canonical constructor (represented as |Can (VAL, VAL)|,
a proof of their equality and an element of the first set, it will try to return
|Right v| where |v| is an element of the second set. If computation is blocked
by a neutral value |n|, it will return |Left n|.

Features must extend this definition using the |Coerce| aspect for every
canonical set-former they introduce. They must handle coercions between all
canonical inhabitants of such sets, but need not deal with neutral inhabitants.
To ensure we can add arbitrary consistent axioms to the system, they should
not inspect the proof, but may eliminate it with |naughtE| if asked to coerce
between incompatible sets.

> coerce :: (Can (VAL,VAL)) -> VAL -> VAL -> Either NEU VAL
> coerce Set q x = Right x
> coerce (Pi (sS1, sS2) (tT1, tT2)) q f1 = 
>   Right . L . HF (fortran tT2) $ \ s2 ->
>     let  (s1, sq) = coeh sS2 sS1 (CON $ q $$ Fst) s2
>          t1 = f1 $$ A s1
>     in   coe @@ [tT1 $$ A s1, tT2 $$ A s2,
>                    CON $ q $$ Snd $$ A s2 $$ A s1 $$ A sq, t1]
> import <- Coerce
> coerce _    q  (N x)  = Left x
> coerce cvv  q  r      = error $ unlines ["coerce: can't cope with sets",
>                             show cvv, "and proof", show q, "and value", show r]


The |partialEq| function takes two sets together with a proof that they are
equal; it returns |True| if they are known to be definitionally equal. This
is sound but not complete for the definitional equality, so if it returns
|False| they might still be equal. It is safe to call during bquote, and
hence during evaluation, because it avoids forcing the types of references.


> partialEq :: VAL -> VAL -> VAL -> Bool
> partialEq _ _ (N (P r :$ _ :$ _))    | r == refl                = True
> partialEq (C (Mu t1)) (C (Mu t2)) _  | eqLabelIncomplete t1 t2  = True
> partialEq _ _ _ = False

Sadly we cannot do the following, because it is not safe to invent a name supply.

< partialEq s t _ = bquote B0 s ns == bquote B0 t ns
<   where ns = (B0 :< ("__partialEq", 0), 0) :: NameSupply
