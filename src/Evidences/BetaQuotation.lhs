As we are in the quotation business, let us define $\beta$-quotation,
ie. |bquote|. Unlike |quote|, |bquote| does not perform
$\eta$-expansion, it just brings the term in $\beta$-normal
form. Therefore, the code is much more simpler than |quote|, although
the idea is the same.

\begin{danger}

It is important to note that we are in a |NameSupplier| and we don't
require a specially crafted |NameSupply| (unlike |quote| and |quop|,
as described above). Because of that, we have to maintain the
variables we have generated and to which De Bruijn index they
correspond. This is the role of the backward list of references. Note
also that we let the user provide an initial environment of
references: this is useful to discharge a bunch of assumptions inside
a term. The typical use-case is |discharge|, below.

\end{danger}

Apart from that, this is a standard $\beta$-quotation: 

> bquote :: NameSupplier m => Bwd REF -> Tm {d,VV} REF -> m (Tm {d,TT} REF)

If binded by one of our lambda, we bind the free variables to the
right lambda. We don't do anything otherwise.

> bquote  refs (P x) =
>     case x `elemIndex` refs of
>       Just i -> pure $ V i 
>       Nothing -> pure $ P x

Constant lambdas are painlessly structural.

> bquote refs (L (K t))   = (| LK (bquote refs t) |)

When we see a syntactic lambda value, we are very happy, because
quotation is just renaming.

> -- bquote refs (L (x :. t)) = (| (refs -|| L (x :. t)) |)

For all other lambdas, it's the usual story: we create a fresh variable,
evaluate the applied term, quote the result, and bring everyone under
a binder.

> bquote refs f@(L _) = 
>     (|(L . (x :.))
>       (freshRef  (x :<: error "bquote: type undefined") 
>                  (\x -> bquote  (refs :< x) 
>                                 (f $$ A (pval x))))|)
>     where x = fortran f

For the other constructors, we simply go through and do as much damage
as we can. Simple, easy.

> bquote refs (C c)       = (| C (traverse (bquote refs) c) |)
> bquote refs (N n)       = (| N (bquote refs n) |)
> bquote refs (n :$ v)    = (| (bquote refs n) :$ (traverse (bquote refs) v) |)
> bquote refs (op :@ vs)  = (| (op :@) (traverse (bquote refs) vs) |)
