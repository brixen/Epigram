\subsection{Type-checking Canonicals and Eliminators}

\subsubsection{Canonical objects}
\label{subsubsec:Evidences.TypeChecker.canTy}


Historically, canonical terms were type-checked by the following
function:

< canTy :: (t -> VAL) -> (Can VAL :>: Can t) -> Maybe (Can (TY :>: t))
< canTy ev (Set :>: Set)    = Just Set
< canTy ev (Set :>: Pi s t) = Just (Pi (SET :>: s) ((ARR (ev s) SET) :>: t)
< canTy _  _            = Nothing

If we temporally forget Features, we have here a type-checker that
takes an evaluation function |ev|, a type, and a term to be checked
against this type. When successful, the result of typing is a
canonical term that contains both the initial term and its normalized
form, as we get it for free during type-checking.

However, to avoid re-implementing the typing rules in various places,
we had to generalize this function. The generalization consists in
parameterizing |canTy| with a type-directed function |TY :>: t -> s|,
which is equivalent to |TY -> t -> s|. Because we still need an
evaluation function, both functions are fused into a single one, of
type: |TY :>: t -> (s,VAL)|.  To support failures, we extend this type
to |TY :>: t -> m (s,VAL)| where |m| is a |MonadError|.

Hence, by defining an appropriate function |chev|, we can recover the
previous definition of |canTy|. We can also do much more: intuitively,
we can write any type-directed function in term of |canTy|. That is,
any function traversing the types derivation tree can be expressed
using |canTy|.

> canTy ::  (Alternative m, MonadError (StackError t) m) =>
>           (TY :>: t -> m (s :=>: VAL)) -> 
>           (Can VAL :>: Can t) ->
>           m (Can (s :=>: VAL))
> canTy chev (Set :>: Set)     = return Set
> canTy chev (Set :>: Pi s t)  = do
>   ssv@(s :=>: sv) <- chev (SET :>: s)
>   ttv@(t :=>: tv) <- chev (ARR sv SET :>: t)
>   return $ Pi ssv ttv
> import <- CanTyRules
> canTy  chev (ty :>: x)  = throwError'  $ err "canTy: the proposed value "
>                                        ++ errCan x
>                                        ++ err " is not of type " 
>                                        ++ errTyVal ((C ty) :<: SET)


\subsubsection{Eliminators}
\label{subsubsec:Evidences.TypeChecker.elimTy}

Type-checking eliminators mirrors |canTy|. |elimTy| is provided with a
checker-evaluator, a value |f| of inferred typed |t|, ie. a |f :<: t|
of |VAL :<: Can VAL|, and an eliminator of |Elim t|. If the operation
is type-safe, we are given back the eliminator enclosing the result of
|chev| and the type of the eliminated value.

it computes the type of the argument,
ie. the eliminator, in |Elim (s :=>: VAL)| and the type of the result in
|TY|.

> elimTy ::  MonadError (StackError t) m =>
>            (TY :>: t -> m (s :=>: VAL)) -> 
>            (VAL :<: Can VAL) -> Elim t ->
>            m (Elim (s :=>: VAL),TY)
> elimTy chev (f :<: Pi s t) (A e) = do
>   eev@(e :=>: ev) <- chev (s :>: e)
>   return $ (A eev, t $$ A ev) 
> import <- ElimTyRules
> elimTy _  (v :<: t) e = throwError'  $ err "elimTy: failed to eliminate" 
>                                      ++ errTyVal (v :<: (C t)) 
>                                      ++ err "with" 
>                                      ++ errElim e

\question{Why not asking |m| to be |Alternative| too?}


> spineTy :: MonadError (StackError t) m =>
>            (TY :>: t -> m (s :=>: VAL)) -> 
>            TY -> Bwd t ->
>            m (Bwd (s :=>: VAL),TY)
> spineTy chev ty B0 = return (B0, ty) 
> spineTy chev ty (sp :< x) = do
>   (spv,PI s t) <- spineTy chev ty sp
>   xxv@(_ :=>: xv) <- chev (s :>: x)
>   return (spv :< xxv,t $$ A xv)

\subsubsection{discharge}

Given a value, we might want to discharge an hypothesis used deep down
in it. That is, provided a free variable |ref|, we have to track it
inside |val| and, when found, bind it to the De Bruijn index 0. This
corresponds to beta-quoting |val| with |ref|. Then, well, we put that
under a lambda and we are discharged.

\adam{Do we need |discharge| for anything? It seems like this is better done
with terms rather than values. I have commented it out for the time being.}

< discharge :: NameSupplier m => REF -> VAL -> m VAL
< discharge ref val = (| (evTm . L . (fst (last (refName ref)) :.)) (bquote (B0 :< ref) val) |)

\subsection{Type checking}
\label{subsec:Evidences.TypeChecker.type-checking}

Here starts the bidirectional type-checking story. In this section, we
address the Checking side. In the next section, we implement the
Inference side. Give Conor a white-board, three pens of different
colors, 30 minutes, and you will know what is happening below in the
Edinburgh style. If you can bear with some black-and-white boring
sequents, keep reading.

The checker works as follow. In a valid typing environment $\Gamma$,
it checks that the term $t$ is indeed of type $T$, ie. $t$ can be
pushed into $T$: |T :>: t|:

$$\Gamma \vdash \mbox{TY} \ni \mbox{Tm \{In,.\} p}$$

Technically, we also need a name supply and handle failure with a
convenient monad. Therefore, we jump in the |Check| monad defined in
Section~\ref{subsec:NameSupply.NameSupplier.check-monad}.

> check :: (TY :>: INTM) -> Check INTM (INTM :=>: VAL)

Type-checking a canonical term is rather easy, as we just have to
delegate the hard work to |canTy|. The checker-evaluator simply needs
to evaluate the well-typed terms.

> check (C cty :>: C ctm) = do
>   cc' <- canTy check (cty :>: ctm)
>   return $ C ctm :=>: (C $ fmap valueOf cc')


As for lambda, it is simple too. We wish the code was simple
too. But, hey, it isn't. The formal typing rule is the following:
%
\[
\Rule{x : S \vdash T x \ni t}
     {\Pi S\ T \ni \lambda x . t}
\]

As for the implementation, we apply the by-now standard trick of
making a fresh variable $x \in S$ and computing the type |T x|. Then,
we simply have to check that $T\ x \ni t$.

> check (PI s t :>: L sc) = do
>   freshRef  ("__check" :<: s) 
>             (\ref -> check (  t $$ A (pval ref) :>: 
>                               underScope sc ref)) 
>   return $ L sc :=>: (evTm $ L sc)

Formally, we can bring the |Ex| terms into the |In| world with the
rule:
%
\[
\Rule{n \in Y  \qquad
      \star \ni W \equiv Y}
     {W \ni n}
\]

This translates naturally into the following code:

> check (w :>: N n) = do
>   r <- askNSupply
>   yv :<: yt <- infer n
>   case (equal (SET :>: (w, yt)) r) of
>     True -> return $ N n :=>: yv
>     False -> throwError'  $   err "check: inferred type"
>                           ++  errTyVal (yt :<: SET)
>                           ++  err "of"
>                           ++  errTyVal (yv :<: yt)
>                           ++  err "is not"
>                           ++  errTyVal (w :<: SET)

Finally, we can extend the checker with the |Check| aspect. If no rule
has matched, then we have to give up.

> import <- Check
> check (ty :>: tm) = throwError'  $ err "check: type mismatch: type"
>                                  ++ errTyVal (ty :<: SET)
>                                  ++ err "does not admit"
>                                  ++ errTm tm


\subsection{Type inference}
\label{subsec:Evidences.TypeChecker.type-inference}

On the inference side, we also have a valid typing environment
$\Gamma$ that is used to pull types |TY| out of |Ex| terms:

$$\Gamma \vdash \mbox{Tm \{Ex,.\} p} \in \mbox{TY}$$

This translates into the following signature:

> infer :: EXTM -> Check INTM (VAL :<: TY)

We all know the rule to infer the type of a free variable from the
context:
%
\[
\CAxiom{\Gamma, x : A, \Delta \vdash x \in A}
\]

In Epigram, parameters carry their types, so it is even easier:

> infer (P x)               = return $ pval x :<: pty x

The rule for eliminators is a generalization of the rule for function
application. Let us give a look at its formal rule:
%
\[
\Rule{f \in \Pi\ S\ T  \qquad
      S \ni x}
     {f x \in {(B x)}^\downarrow}
\]

The story is the same in the general case: we infer the eliminated
term |t| and we type-check the eliminator, using |elimTy|. Because
|elimTy| computes the result type, we have inferred the result type.

> infer (t :$ s)           = do
>     val :<: ty <- infer t
>     case ty of
>         C cty -> do
>             (s', ty') <- elimTy check (val :<: cty) s
>             return $ (val $$ (fmap valueOf s')) :<: ty'
>         _ -> throwError' $ err "infer: inferred type"
>                            ++ errTyVal (ty :<: SET)
>                            ++ err "of"
>                            ++ errTyVal (val :<: ty)
>                            ++ err "is not canonical."

Following exactly the same principle, we can infer the result of an
operator application:

> infer (op :@ ts)         = do
>   (vs,t) <- opTy op check ts
>   return $ (op @@ (fmap valueOf vs)) :<: t

Type ascription is formalized by the following rule:
%
\[
\Rule{\star \ni \mbox{ty}  \qquad
      \mbox{ty}^\downarrow \ni t}
     {(t :\in T) \in \mbox{ty}^\downarrow}
\]

Which translates directly into the following code:

> infer (t :? ty)           = do
>   _ :=>:  vty  <- check (SET  :>: ty  )
>   _ :=>:  v    <- check (vty  :>: t   )
>   return $ v :<: vty

Obviously, if none of the rule above applies, then there is something
fishy.

> infer _                   = throwError' $ err "infer: unable to infer type"
