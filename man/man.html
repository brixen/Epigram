   <h3>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h3>
   <p> Epigram 2 is intended to be a full-scale dependently typed
    programming language in the spirit of Epigram 1 and Agda. It isn't
    finished yet. This document explains how to interact with the
    system as it exists at the moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Work on the high level programming language has just started. In
    the meantime we can write programs in a more low level fashion
    using Cochon. Cochon looks more like a theorem prover than
    a programming IDE and it's quite low level: the guts are
    showing. Read on for a tutorial of how to write some simple
    programs in Cochon. For a glossary of Cochon commands skip to the
    appendix.

   <h3>Chapter 3 - Running Epigram</h3>
   <p>
    For the moment we interact with Epigram using the Cochon
    interactive theorem prover:
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>$ cd Pig09/src</code><br>
    <code>$ ./Pig</code>
   </p>
   <p>Cochon responds with a prompt:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; _</code></p>
   <p>To exit Cochon you can type
   <p><code>&gt; quit_</code>
   <p>and press return.</p>
  </section>

   <h3>Chapter 4 - My first Epigram Program</h3>
   <p>
    As a first warm-up exercise we will perform the arithmetic feat of
    adding two and two. First of all let's define the natural numbers
    in Peano style. Enter the following at Cochon's prompt and press
    return:
   </p>
   <p><code>&gt; data Nat := (zero : Nat) ; (suc : Nat -> Nat)</code></p>
   <p>We defined a new data type <code>Nat</code> and with two
   constructors <code>zero</code> which takes no arguments
   and <code>suc</code> which takes a natural number and gives us back
   another natural number. There are two canonical forms of natural
   number: either it's zero; or it's the successor of another natural
   number. When we define a datatype in Epigram, and give constructors
   for its canonical forms, we are automatically given a computation
   mechanism (an elimination principle) which says that if we want to
   write a program that consumes elements of that datatype we need
   only explain what to do for its canonical forms. This is because
   any element of a datatype is equal to an element in canonical
   form.
   </p>
   <p>If we want to look at the gory details of what this has
   generated we can type</p>
   <p>
    <code>&gt show state</code>
   </p>
   <p>
    Having defined <code>Nat</code> we can now define some numbers. Let's
    dip our metaphorical toe in the water by defining the number one.
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>&gt; make one : Nat</code>
   </p>
   <p>Cochon responds</p>
   <p>
    <code>
      Appended goal!<br>
      Goal: Nat
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>and the prompt has changed:</p>
   <p><code>one_1 &gt;</code</p>
   <p>This tells us we are no longer at the root of the proof state,
   instead we are inside the goal one_1. The <code>_1</code> part is
   just appended to the name internally to guarantee that names are
   unique. This is an example of the innards visible in Cochon.
   <p>
    We have created a programming problem called <code>one^1</code> of
    type <code>Nat</code>. We can fill it in directly by responding:
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>&gt; give 'suc 'zero</code> 
   </p>
   <p>Cochon responds</p>
   <p><code>Thank you.</code></p>
   <p>What are the apostrophies? Well, they are the tags of the
   constructors we generated. If we want to refer to 0
   as <code>zero</code> we can define it using <code>make</code> as we
   did for <code>one</code>.
   <p>We can 'test our new definition by typing:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; elab one</code></p>
   <p>Cochon responds</p>
   <p><code>'suc 'zero</code></p>
   <p>What a relief!</p>
   <p>For the purposes of doing some gratuitous navigation in Cochon
   let's define a couple more constants:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; make two : Nat</code></p>
   <p>We're placed inside our newly created goal by Cochon. This time
   we won't fill it in immediately instead let's go back out to the
   root and make another definition.</p>
   <p><code>two_2 &gt; out</code></p>
   <p>This takes us out a level. In this case it is to the root of the
   proof state (as we can see from the Cochon prompt). We could have
   achieved the same thing by typing:</p>
   <p><code>two_2 &gt; root</code></p>
   <p>Let's make another definition:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; make three : Nat</code></p>
   <p>Cochon places us inside new goal:
   <p><code>three_3 &gt;</code></p>
   <p>To return to the previous one we type:</p>
   <p><code>three_3 &gt; prev</code></p>
   <p>Let's fill it in:</p>
   <p><code>two_2 &gt; give 'suc one</code></p>
   <p>Cochon politely thanks us and moves us to the next goal which we
   can fill in too:</p>
   <p><code>three_3 &gt; give 'suc two</code></p>
   <p>With this our work is done and we're back at the root. We can
   test our last definition by typing:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; elab three</code></p>
   <p>Having mastered the art of defining constants let's define a
   recursive function next.</p>
   <p><code> &gt; let plus (m : Nat)(n : Nat) : Nat</code></p>
   <p>
    <code>
     Let there be plus.<br>
     \ m : Nat -&gt;<br>
     \ n : Nat -&gt;<br>
     Programming: &lt; plus^1 m n : Nat &gt;<br>
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>So, we now have a programming problem, our context
   contains <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> of type <code>Nat</code>
   and we must deliver a <code>Nat</code>. To do this we first
   indicate to Cochon that we would like to proceed by induction
   on <code>m</code>:</p>
   <p><code>plus_5.impl_2 &gt; &lt;= Nat.Ind m</code></p>
   <p>Cochon tells us that things have been <code>Eliminated and
   simplified.</code> Simplified? To me it looks more complicated but
   if we look carefully we see our programming problem has
   changed:</p>
   <p><code>Programming: &lt; plus^1 'zero n : Nat &gt;</code></p>
   <p>We know very well that 0 + n = n and our first thought might be
   to respond <code>give n</code>. But this doesn't work. Our goal is
   not just a natural number it is a <i>programming problem</i>. To
   fill in such a goal we use a new keyword <code>return</code>. So we
   must type:</p>
   <p>
    <code>
     ... &gt; give return n
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>Or if we are lazy (we are) we could type:</p>
   <p><code>... &gt; = n</code></p>
   <p>This is just shorthand for the <code>give return</code>. Either
   of these will do and after pressing return Cochon
   says <code>Ta.</code> and moves us to the next goal:</p>
   <p><code>Programming: &lt; plus^1 ('suc xf^1) n : Nat &gt;</code></p>
   <p><code>xf^1</code> isn't the nicest name, <code>m</code> would be
   better so instead of using <code>=</code> again let's use a
   different tactic that lets us choose our own names</p>
   <p><code>... &gt; define plus ('suc m) n := 'suc (plus m n)</code></p>

   <p>Cochon responds with just <code>Hurrah!</code>. He must really
   like this tactic.
   <p>We can get back to the root and then check that 2 + 2 indeed
   equals 4.</p>
   <p><code>&gt; elab plus two two</code></p>
   <p>
    <code>'suc ('suc ('suc ('suc 'zero)))</code></p>
   <p>Well, thank god for that! Our first Epigram program is finished.</p>
   <p>If you have EPIC installed you can also compile</p>
   <p>
    <code>
      &gt; make twoplustwo : Nat<br>
      &gt; give plus two two<br>
      &gt; compile twoplustwo twoplustwo
    </code>
   </p>
   <p><strike>I'll stop here as we've temporarily overtaken
   reality.</strike> Reality moves in fits and starts if you don't pay
   close attention it can whizz past when you're not looking.</p>
  </section>
  <h3>Chapter 5 - My second Epigram program</h3>
   <p>This section is ingloriously ripped from the epilogue
   post <a href="http://www.e-pig.org/epilogue/?p=683">The Art of the
   Possible</a>.</p>

   <p>With those preliminaries out of the way, on to the new
   stuff. First, Peter&#8217;s shiny new <code>idata</code> tactic allows
   indexed data types to be written in a nice syntax (nicer than codes,
   anyway). As usual, parameters occur before the colon and indices
   afterwards.</p>

   <p><code>idata Vec (A : Set) : Nat -&gt; Set := (nil : Vec A 'zero) ;
   (cons : A -&gt; (n : Nat) -&gt; Vec A n -&gt; Vec A ('suc n))
   ;</code></p>

   <p>Once we have <code>plus</code> and vectors, what could be more
   natural than writing vector append? This has become much more pleasant
   in recent weeks, because equations that once had to be eliminated by
   hand are now dealt with automatically. Now you can write the program
   you would expect, more or less.</p>

   <p><code>let append (A : Set)(m : Nat)(as : Vec A m)(n : Nat)(bs : Vec
   A n) : Vec A (plus m n) ;<br /> &lt;= Vec.Ind A m as ;<br /> define
   append A 'zero 'nil n bs := bs ;<br /> define append A ('suc k) ('cons
   a k as) n bs := 'cons a (plus k n) (append A k as n bs) ;<br /> root
   ;</code></p>

   <p>Finally, let us test our function:</p>

   <p><code>make as := 'cons 'true one ('cons 'false 'zero 'nil) : Vec
   Bool two ;<br /> make bs := 'cons 'false one ('cons 'true 'zero 'nil)
   : Vec Bool two ;<br /> elaborate append Bool two as two bs
   ;</code></p>

   <p>The output is not as pretty as it could be, and better implicit
   argument support could make the code a bit less verbose, but working
   with Epigram is starting to look like programming!</p>
