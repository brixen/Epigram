   <h3>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h3>
   <p> 
    Epigram 2 is intended to be a full-scale dependently typed
    programming language in the spirit of Epigram 1 and Agda. It isn't
    finished yet. We've made some of the bits and plugged them
    together. This document explains how to interact with the system
    as it exists at the moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the time of writing the best way to do this is to use the
    Cochon tool for interactive program development. Cochon looks more
    like a theorem prover than a programming IDE and it's quite low
    level: the guts are showing. Read on for a tutorial of how to
    write some simple programs in Cochon. For a glossary of Cochon
    commands skip to the appendix.

   <h3>Chapter 3 - Running Epigram</h3>
   <p>
    For the moment we interact with Epigram using the Cochon
    interactive theorem prover:
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>$ cd Pig09/src</code><br>
    <code>$ ./Pig</code>
   </p>
   <p>Cochon responds with a prompt:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; _</code></p>
   <p>To exit Cochon you can type
   <p><code>&gt; quit_</code>
   <p>and press return.</p>

   <h3>Chapter 4 - My first Epigram Program</h3>
   <p>
    As a first warm-up exercise we will perform the arithmetic feat of
    adding two and two. First of all let's define the natural numbers
    in Peano style. Enter the following at Cochon's prompt and press
    return:
   </p>
   <p><code>&gt; data Nat := (zero : Nat) ; (suc : Nat -> Nat)</code></p>
   <p>We defined a new data type <code>Nat</code> and with two
   constructors <code>zero</code> which takes no arguments
   and <code>suc</code> which takes a natural number and gives us back
   another natural number. There are two canonical forms of natural
   number: either it's zero; or it's the successor of another natural
   number. When we define a datatype in Epigram, and give constructors
   for its canonical forms, we are automatically given a computation
   mechanism (an elimination principle) which says that if we want to
   write a program that consumes elements of that datatype we need
   only explain what to do for its canonical forms. This is because
   any element of a datatype is equal to an element in canonical
   form.
   </p>
   <p>If we want to look at the gory details of what this has
   generated we can type</p>
   <p>
    <code>&gt show state</code>
   </p>
   <p>
    Having defined <code>Nat</code> we can now define some numbers. Let's
    dip our metaphorical toe in the water by defining the number one.
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>&gt; make one : Nat</code>
   </p>
   <p>Cochon responds</p>
   <p>
    <code>
      Appended goal!<br>
      Goal: Nat
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>and the prompt has changed:</p>
   <p><code>one_1 &gt;</code</p>
   <p>This tells us we are no longer at the root of the proof state,
   instead we are inside the goal one_1. The <code>_1</code> part is
   just appended to the name internally to guarantee that names are
   unique. This is an example of the innards visible in Cochon.
   <p>
    We have created a programming problem called <code>one^1</code> of
    type <code>Nat</code>. We can fill it in directly by responding:
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>&gt; give 'suc 'zero</code> 
   </p>
   <p>Cochon responds</p>
   <p><code>Thank you.</code></p>
   <p>What are the apostrophies? Well, they are the tags of the
   constructors we generated. If we want to refer to 0
   as <code>zero</code> we can define it using <code>make</code> as we
   did for <code>one</code>.
   <p>We can 'test our new definition by typing:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; elab one</code></p>
   <p>Cochon responds</p>
   <p><code>'suc 'zero</code></p>
   <p>What a relief!</p>
   <p>For the purposes of doing some gratuitous navigation in Cochon
   let's define a couple more constants:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; make two : Nat</code></p>
   <p>We're placed inside our newly created goal by Cochon. This time
   we won't fill it in immediately instead let's go back out to the
   root and make another definition.</p>
   <p><code>two_2 &gt; out</code></p>
   <p>This takes us out a level. In this case it is to the root of the
   proof state (as we can see from the Cochon prompt). We could have
   achieved the same thing by typing:</p>
   <p><code>two_2 &gt; root</code></p>
   <p>Let's make another definition:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; make three : Nat</code></p>
   <p>Cochon places us inside new goal:
   <p><code>three_3 &gt;</code></p>
   <p>To return to the previous one we type:</p>
   <p><code>three_3 &gt; prev</code></p>
   <p>Let's fill it in:</p>
   <p><code>two_2 &gt; give 'suc one</code></p>
   <p>Cochon politely thanks us and moves us to the next goal which we
   can fill in too:</p>
   <p><code>three_3 &gt; give 'suc two</code></p>
   <p>With this our work is done and we're back at the root. We can
   test our last definition by typing:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; elab three</code></p>
   <p>Having mastered the art of defining constants let's define a
   recursive function next.</p>
   <p><code> &gt; let plus (m : Nat)(n : Nat) : Nat</code></p>
   <p>
    <code>
     Let there be plus.<br>
     \ m : Nat -&gt;<br>
     \ n : Nat -&gt;<br>
     Programming: &lt; plus^1 m n : Nat &gt;<br>
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>So, we now have a programming problem, our context
   contains <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> of type <code>Nat</code>
   and we must deliver a <code>Nat</code>. To do this we first
   indicate to Cochon that we would like to proceed by induction
   on <code>m</code>:</p>
   <p><code>plus_4.plus-impl_2 &gt; &lt;= Nat.Ind m</code></p>
   <p>Cochon tells us that things have been <code>Eliminated and
   simplified.</code> To me it looks more complicated but if we look
   carefully we see our programming problem has changed:</p>
   <p><code>Programming: &lt; plus^1 'zero n : Nat &gt;</code></p>
   <p>We know very well that 0 + n = n and our first thought might be
   to respond <code>give n</code>. But this doesn't work. Our goal is
   not just a natural number it is a <i>programming problem</i>. To
   fill in such a goal we use a new keyword <code>return</code>. So we
   must type:</p>
   <p>
    <code>
     ... &gt; give return n
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>Or if we are lazy (we are) we could type:</p>
   <p><code>... &gt; = n</code></p>
   <p>This is just shorthand for the <code>give return</code>. Either
   of these will do and after pressing return Cochon
   says <code>Ta.</code> and moves us to the next goal:</p>
   <p><code>Programming: &lt; plus^1 ('suc xf^1) n : Nat &gt;</code></p>
   <p><code>xf^1</code> isn't the nicest name, <code>m</code> would
   have been nicer but let's not make a fuss about it now. We can fill
   in the step case with this:</p>
   <p><code>... &gt; = 'suc (plus xf^1 n)</code></p>
   <p>Cochon responds with just <code>Ta.</code> as we don't have
   anymore goals.
   <p>We can get back to the root and then check that 2 + 2 indeed
   equals 4.</p>
   <p><code>&gt; elab plus two two</code></p>
   <p>
    <code>'suc ('suc ('suc ('suc 'zero)))</code></p>
   <p>Well, thank god for that! Our first Epigram program is finished.</p>
   <p>If you have EPIC installed you can also compile</p>
   <p>
    <code>
      &gt; make twoplustwo : Nat<br>
      &gt; give plus two two<br>
      &gt; compile twoplustwo twoplustwo
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>I'll stop here as we've temporarily overtaken reality.</p>
