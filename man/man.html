   <h3>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h3>
   <p> Epigram 2 is intended to be a full-scale dependently typed
    programming language in the spirit of Epigram 1 and Agda. It isn't
    finished yet. This document explains how to interact with the
    system as it exists at the moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Work on the high level programming language has just started. In
    the meantime we can write programs in a more low level fashion
    using Cochon. Cochon looks more like a theorem prover than a
    programming IDE and it's quite low level; if you look closely you
    can see the cogs whirring. Read on for a tutorial of how to write
    some simple programs in Cochon. For a glossary of Cochon commands
    skip to the appendix.

   <h3>Chapter 3 - Running Epigram</h3>
   <p>
    For the moment we interact with Epigram using the Cochon
    interactive theorem prover. You can invoke it directly at the command line:
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>$ Pig</code>
   </p>
   <p>Cochon responds with a prompt:</p>
   <p><code>&gt;</code></p>
   <p>To exit Cochon you can type
   <p><code>&gt; quit</code>
   <p>and press return.</p>

   <p>You can also run it in emacs if you insert something like this
   in your <code>.emacs</code>:</p>
   <p><code>(load "/home/dave/Pig09/pigmode.el")</code></p>
   <p>Then when you open a <code>.pig</code> file you should get some
   syntax highlighting. A pig file is just a sequence of Cochon
   commands seperated by semicolons. With the cursor on the first line
   of said pig file, press C-c C-r. This will open a seperate emacs
   'window' for Cochon in the bottom half of the 'frame' and send the
   first line of your file to it. Further presses of C-c C-r will send
   subsequent lines. We can interact with (and quit!)  Cochon in its
   emacs window just as we did from the command line.</p> Have a look
   in the <code>test</code> directory for some
   sample <code>.pig</code> files.

   <h3>Chapter 4 - My first Epigram Program: 2 + 2</h3>
   <p>
    As a first warm-up exercise we will perform the arithmetic feat of
    adding two and two. First of all let's define the natural numbers
    in Peano style. Enter the following at Cochon's prompt and press
    return:
   </p>
   <p><code>&gt; data Nat := ('zero : Nat) ; ('suc : Nat -&gt; Nat)</code></p>
   <p>We defined a new data type <code>Nat</code> and with two
   constructors <code>'zero</code> which takes no arguments
   and <code>'suc</code> which takes a natural number and gives us
   back another natural number. The <code>'</code> is Epigram's
   current notation for a constructor name. There are two canonical
   forms of natural number: either it's zero; or it's the successor of
   another natural number. When we define a datatype in Epigram, and
   give constructors for its canonical forms, we are automatically
   given a computation mechanism (an elimination principle) which says
   that if we want to write a program that consumes elements of that
   datatype we need only explain what to do for its canonical
   forms. This is because any element of a datatype is equal to an
   element in canonical form.
   </p>
   <p>If we want to look at the gory details of what this has
   generated we can type</p>
   <p>
    <code>&gt; show state</code>
   </p>
   <p>
    Having defined <code>Nat</code> we can now define some numbers. Let's
    dip our metaphorical toe in the water by defining the number one.
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>&gt; make one : Nat</code>
   </p>
   <p>Cochon responds</p>
   <p>
    <code>
      Appended goal!<br>
      Goal: Nat
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>and the prompt has changed:</p>
   <p><code>one_1 &gt;</code></p>
   <p>This tells us we are no longer at the root of the proof state,
   instead we are inside the goal one_1. The <code>_1</code> part is
   just appended to the name internally to guarantee that names are
   unique. This is an example of the innards visible in Cochon.</p>
   <p>
    We have created a programming problem called <code>one^1</code> of
    type <code>Nat</code>. We can fill it in directly by responding:
   </p>
   <p>
    <code>&gt; give 'suc 'zero</code> 
   </p>
   <p>Cochon responds</p>
   <p><code>Thank you.</code></p>
   <p>Note that <code>one</code> doesn't have an apostrophe at the
   beginning as it is not a constructor. We can 'test' our new
   definition by typing:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; elab one</code></p>
   <p>Cochon responds</p>
   <p><code>'suc 'zero</code></p>
   <p>Well, that's a relief!</p>
   <p>For the purposes of doing some gratuitous navigation in Cochon
   let's define a couple more constants:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; make two : Nat</code></p>
   <p>We're placed inside our newly created goal by Cochon. This time
   we won't fill it in immediately instead let's go back out to the
   root and make another definition.</p>
   <p><code>two_2 &gt; out</code></p>
   <p>This takes us out a level. In this case it is to the root of the
   proof state (as we can see from the Cochon prompt). We could have
   achieved the same thing by typing:</p>
   <p><code>two_2 &gt; root</code></p>
   <p>Let's make another definition:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; make three : Nat</code></p>
   <p>Cochon places us inside new goal:
   <p><code>three_3 &gt;</code></p>
   <p>To return to the previous one we type:</p>
   <p><code>three_3 &gt; prev</code></p>
   <p>Let's fill it in:</p>
   <p><code>two_2 &gt; give 'suc one</code></p>
   <p>Cochon politely thanks us and moves us to the next goal which we
   can fill in too:</p>
   <p><code>three_3 &gt; give 'suc two</code></p>
   <p>With this our work is done and we're back at the root. We can
   test our last definition by typing:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; elab three</code></p>
   <p>Having mastered the art of defining constants let's define a
   recursive function next.</p>
   <p><code> &gt; let plus (m : Nat)(n : Nat) : Nat</code></p>
   <p>
    <code>
     Let there be plus.<br>
     \ m : Nat -&gt;<br>
     \ n : Nat -&gt;<br>
     Programming: &lt; plus m n : Nat &gt;<br>
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>So, we now have a programming problem, our context
   contains <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> of type <code>Nat</code>
   and we must deliver a <code>Nat</code>. To solve programming
   problems we use the <code>refine</code> tactic. We give a left hand
   side which allows us to choose suitable names for the arguments,
   either <code>&lt;=</code> (invoke a principle such as induction)
   or <code>=</code> (return something) and a right hand side. Here we
   indicate to Cochon that we would like to proceed by induction
   on <code>m</code>:</p>
   <p><code>... &gt; refine plus m n  &lt;= Nat.Ind m</code></p>
   <p>Cochon tells us that things have been <code>Eliminated and
   simplified.</code> Simplified? To me it looks more complicated but
   if we look carefully we see our context and the programming problem have
   changed:</p>
   <p><code>\ n : Nat -><br>
            Programming: &lt; plus 'zero n : Nat &gt;</code></p>
   <p>We know very well that 0 + n = n and our first thought might be
   to respond <code>give n</code>. But this doesn't work. Our goal is
   not just a natural number it is a <i>programming problem</i> which
   must be sovled using <code>refine</code>, this time accompanied
   by <code>=</code>.  So, we must type:</p>
   <p>
    <code>
     ... &gt; refine plus 'zero n = n
    </code>
   </p>
   <p>After pressing return Cochon
   says <code>Hurrah.</code> and moves us to the next goal:</p>
   <p><code>Programming: &lt; plus ('suc xf) n : Nat &gt;</code></p>
   <p><code>xf</code> isn't the nicest name, <code>m</code> would be
   better so we type:</p>
   <p><code>... &gt; refine plus ('suc m) n := 'suc (plus m n)</code></p>

   <p>Cochon responds with <code>Hurrah!</code>. Our definition is
   complete but we are left inside it. To extracate ourselves we can type</p>
   <p><code>... &gt; root</code></p>
   <p>and then to check that 2 + 2 indeed equals 4:</p>
   <p><code>&gt; elab plus two two</code></p>
   <p>
    <code>'suc ('suc ('suc ('suc 'zero)))</code></p>
   <p>Well, thank god for that! Our first Epigram program is finished.</p>
   <p>If you have EPIC installed you can also compile</p>
   <p>
    <code>
      &gt; make twoplustwo : Nat<br>
      &gt; give plus two two<br>
      &gt; compile twoplustwo twoplustwo
    </code>

  <h3>Chapter 5 - Vectors and Finite sets</h3>
   <p>This section started out as the epilogue
   post <a href="http://www.e-pig.org/epilogue/?p=683">The Art of the
   Possible</a>.</p>

   <p>Peter's shiny new <code>idata</code> tactic allows
   indexed data types to be written in a nice syntax (nicer than codes,
   anyway):</p>
   <p><code>&gt; idata Vec (A : Set) : Nat -&gt; Set := ('nil : Vec A 'zero) ;
   ('cons : A -&gt; (n : Nat) -&gt; Vec A n -&gt; Vec A ('suc n))
   </code></p>  
   <p>
   As in Agda, parameters occur before the colon and indices
   afterwards. We define vectors, parameristed by a carrier
   type <code>A</code> and indexed by their length (hence the
   type <code>Nat -&gt; Set</code>). The empty vector is
   made by the constructor <code>'nil</code> which takes no arguments and has
   length <code>'zero</code>. A nonempty vector is made by the
   constructor <code>'cons</code> which attaches a new element to an
   old vector. It takes arguments for the new
   element of the carrier <code>A</code>, the length of the old
   vector <code>(n : Nat)</code>, the old vector of type <code>Vec A n</code>
   and produces a new vector of type <code>Vec A ('suc n)</code>. The
   explicit length argument to <code>'cons</code> will be made
   implicit in the future.

   <p>Once we have <code>plus</code> and vectors, what could be more
   natural than writing vector append? Apart from the extra noise of
   the explicit length arguments the program is identical to list
   append. In the future we will be able to make the lenght arguments
   implicit on the left and the right as we do in Agda. One could also
   say that without the extra noise of the elements of <code>A</code>
   the program is identical to <code>plus</code>.</p>

   <p><code>
     &gt; let append (A : Set)(m : Nat)(as : Vec A m)(n : Nat)(bs : Vec
       A n) : Vec A (plus m n) ;<br />
     &gt; refine append A m n as bs &lt;= Vec.Ind A m as ;<br />
     &gt; refine append A 'zero 'nil n bs := bs ;<br />
     &gt; refine append A ('suc k) ('cons
        a k as) n bs := 'cons a (plus k n) (append A k as n bs) ;<br />
     &gt; root
   ;</code></p>

   <p>Finally, let us test our function:</p>

   <p><code>&gt; make as := 'cons 'true one ('cons 'false 'zero 'nil) : Vec
   Bool two ;<br />&gt; make bs := 'cons 'false one ('cons 'true 'zero 'nil)
   : Vec Bool two ;<br />&gt; elaborate append Bool two as two bs
   ;</code></p>

   <p>We can use the length information present in the type of a
   vector to guarantee that we never get an error akin to 'array index
   out of bounds'. To do this we introduce a type of bounded
   indices: <code>Fin</code> and then use it to write a safe lookup
   function. This type will be familiar to some but it's rather
   mysterious if you haven't seen it before. The idea is that it
   represents elements of a finite set of indices which is indexed by
   its size. <code>Fin n</code> corresponds to the set {0,...,n}. The
   element <code>'zero</code> is present in all non-empty finite sets
   hence its type <code>Fin ('suc n)</code> for
   any <code>n</code>. The constructor <code>'suc</code> makes an
   element a non-empty finite set by taking an element in a finite set
   one shorter. Note there is no way of making an element of the empty
   finite set as neither constructor can target <code>Fin
   'zero</code>. The best way to get your head around this type is to
   try to enumerate all the possible elements of the first few finite
   sets: <code>Fin 'zero</code>; <code>Fin ('suc 'zero)</code>;
   etc.</p>

   <p><code>&gt; idata Fin : Nat -&gt; Set := ('zero : (n : Nat) -&gt; Fin ('suc
   n)) ; ('suc : (n : Nat) -&gt; Fin n -&gt; Fin ('suc n)) ; </code></p>

   <p>Having defined <code>Fin</code> we can now define a lookup
   function for vectors that will never go out of bounds, we do this
   by taking a vector of length <code>n</code> and an index from a
   finite set of <code>n</code> elements.</p>

   <p><code>&gt; let lookup (A : Set)(n : Nat)(as : Vec A n)(i : Fin n) : A
   ;</code></p>  

   <p>We proceed by induction on the index <code>i</code>. We could
   have chosen to start with induction on the vector <code>as</code>
   but choosing the index means we only have to deal with cases for
   the possible indexes, there are only indexes in non-empty index sets and
   hence into non-empty vectors.</p>

   <p><code>&gt; refine lookup A n as i &lt;= Fin.Ind n i ;</code></p>

   <p>This gives us a programming problem:</p>

   <p><code>Programming: &lt; lookup A ('suc n) as ('zero n)
   &gt; </code></p>

   <p>We notice that the length argument is <code>'suc n</code> and
   sure enough if we do case analysis on the vector <code>as</code> we
   will only get a case for <code>'cons</code>. Here we use induction
   as a heavy handed way of doing case analysis. Case analysis is a
   neutered induction with the inductive hypothesis cut off.</p>

   <p><code>&gt; refine lookup A ('suc n) as ('zero n) &lt;= Vec.Ind A ('suc
   n) as ;<br>
           Programming: &lt; lookup A ('suc n) ('cons n a as) ('zero n) : A &gt;
 </code></p>

  <p>Having performed enough analysis we can fill in this case, for
  the index <code>'zero</code> we will return the head
  element <code>a</code> of the vector:</p>
  
  <p><code>&gt; refine lookup A ('suc n) ('cons n a as) ('zero n)  = a ; </code></p>

  <p>Epigram responds <code>Hurrah!</code> and presents us with the
  next problem:</p>

  <p><code>Programming: &lt; lookup A ('suc n) as ('suc n i) : A &gt;</code></p>

  <p>As before we must have a non-empty vector as the length argument
  is <code>'suc n</code>. We do case analysis on the vector with our induction
  principle again and get a more informative problem:</p>

  <p><code>&gt; refine lookup A ('suc n) as ('suc n i) &lt;= Vec.Ind A ('suc
  n) as ; <br>
           Programming: &lt; lookup A ('suc n) ('cons n a as) ('suc n i)
  : A &gt;</code></p>

  <p>This time our index is greater than zero, so we must peal off the
  outer <code>'cons</code> constructor of the vector
  and continue the lookup on the tail of the vector. To do this we
  also decrement the index by one by pealing off the <code>'suc</code>
  constructor:</p>

  <p><code>&gt; refine lookup A ('suc n) ('cons n a as) ('suc n i)  = lookup A n
  as i ; </code></p>

  <p>We get another <code>Hurrah!</code> and our definition is
  complete. We have defined a lookup function that takes a vector and
  an index that is guaranteed to be within the vector and we return an
  element of the vector's carrier. What would this function do if we
  didn't give it the index argument? It would be a function that takes
  a vector <code>Vec A n</code> and returns a function <code>Fin n -&gt;
  A</code>. What is such a function? It is a higher-order
  representation of a vector. So, lookup takes a first order vector
  and returns a higher order one. Can we go the other way? Yes. Let's
  define a function <code>tabulate</code> which takes a function of
  type <code>Fin n -&gt; A</code> and gives us a first order
  representation of it as a type <code>Vec A n</code>.

  <p><code>&gt; let tabulate (A : Set)(n : Nat)(f : Fin n -&gt; A) : Vec A n
  ; </code><p>

  <p>How do we proceed? Well, there's not choice, let's do induction
  on <code>n</code>:</p>

  <p><code>&gt; refine tabulate A n f &lt;= Nat.Ind n ; </code></p>

  <p>This gives us the programming problem:</p>
  
  <p><code>Programming: &lt; tabulate A 'zero f : Vec A 'zero &gt;</code></p>

  <p>Well, we don't need to use our brains just yet. We need to make
  an empty vector. So, we only have one option; <code>'nil</code>.</p>
  
  <p><code>&gt; refine tabulate A 'zero f = 'nil ; </code></p>

  <p>On to the case for <code>'suc</code>:</p>

  <p><code>Programming: &lt; tabulate A ('suc n) f : Vec A ('suc n) &gt;</code></p>

  <p>The idea is to fill the vector from left to right by enumerating
  f 0, f 1, f 2, etc. So, we start by <code>'cons n (f ('zero
  n))</code> but what do we give as the tail of the vector? If we look
  in the context we can see that can invoke our inductive
  hypothesis <code>&lt; tabulate A n f : Vec A n &gt;</code>. This
  will do fine for the tail of the vector the only problem is we need
  a function <code>f</code> of type <code>Fin n -&gt; A</code> and
  our <code>f</code> is of type <code>Fin ('suc n) -&gt; A</code>. If
  we were somehow able to overlook this type error then we'd end up
  with a vector f 0, f 0, f 0, etc. We need to increment the index
  each time we make a recursive call. We do this by passing the
  function <code>\ i -&gt; f ('suc n i)</code> to tabulate with does
  the job and has the correct type:</p>

   <p><code>&gt; refine tabulate A ('suc n) f = 'cons n (f ('zero n))
   (tabulate A n (\ i -&gt; f ('suc n i))) ; </code></p>

  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>Lambda Calculus</h3>
  <p>We can define the well-scoped lambda terms as an datatype indexed
  by the number of varialbes it in scope. Any term of this type will
  be guaranteed to be well-scoped, it will have no possibility of
  dangling variables or unintended capture. We use the
  type <code>Fin</code> again. This time to represent nameless
  variables as de Bruijn indices:</p>

  <p><code>&gt; idata Fin : Nat -&gt; Set := ('zero : (n : Nat) -&gt; Fin ('suc
  n)) ; ('suc : (n : Nat) -&gt; Fin n -&gt; Fin ('suc n)) ; </code></p>

  <p>Before proceeding to define lambda terms we explain how to weaken
  a renaming:</p>

  <p><code>let wk (m : Nat)(n : Nat)(f : Fin m -&gt; Fin n)(i : Fin ('suc
  m)) : Fin ('suc n) ;<br>
  refine wk m n f i &lt;= Fin.Ind ('suc m) i ;<br>
  refine wk m n f ('zero m) = 'zero n ;<br>
  refine wk m n f ('suc m i) = 'suc n (f i) ;
  </code></p>

  <p>The data type of lambda terms is defined as follow:</p>

  <p><code>idata Lam : Nat -&gt; Set := ('var : (n : Nat) -&gt; Fin n -&gt; Lam
  n) ; ('app : (n : Nat) -&gt; Lam n -&gt; Lam n -&gt; Lam n) ; ('lam : (n :
  Nat) -&gt; Lam ('suc n) -&gt; Lam n) ;</code></p>

  <p>Having defined lambda terms we define renaming:</p>

  <p<code>let ren (m : Nat)(n : Nat)(f : Fin m -&gt; Fin n)(t : Lam m)
  : Lam n ; <br>
  refine ren m n f t &lt;= Lam.Ind m t ; <br>
  refine ren m n f ('var m i) = 'var n (f i) ; <br>
  refine ren m n f ('app m t u) = 'app n (ren m n f t) (ren m n f u) ; <br>
  refine ren m n f ('lam m t) = 'lam n (ren ('suc m) ('suc n) (wk m n f)
		      t) ; 
  </code></p>

  <p>Unfortunately feeding the last line of this definition to Cochon
  triggers a space leak at the time of writing</p>
