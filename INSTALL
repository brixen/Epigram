If you're just looking to try the Epigram2 command line program Pig,
it isn't hard to build. Assuming that you have the Haskell platform
2010.1.0.0 installed, open a terminal window where you want to put
stuff and:

1. Install She, probably not from Hackage
(see http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~conor/pub/she/)
> darcs get http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~conor/pub/she/
> cd she
> cabal install
[Or:
> cabal --global --root-cmd=sudo install
]
cd ..

[ If you didn't install She using --global then:
> export PATH=~/.cabal/bin:$PATH
]

2. Install Epigram2
> darcs get http://www.e-pig.org/darcs/Pig09/
> cd Pig09/src
> make depend
> make Pig
> make test

On Ubuntu 10.04 I found that installing the Platform is much more
painful than the following:

0. Install ghc stuff by running Applications -> Ubuntu Software
Center. Install: ghc6, darcs, cabal-install, libghc6-mtl-dev.

Later, to update Epigram2, open the terminal window like before and:
[ If you didn't install She using --global then:
> export PATH=~/.cabal/bin:$PATH
]
> cd Pig09
> darcs pull
> cd src
> make clean
> make depend
> make Pig
